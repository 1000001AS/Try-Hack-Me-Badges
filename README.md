TryHackMe Badge Showcase

Welcome to my TryHackMe badge repository!

As part of my journey in cybersecurity and information assurance, I’ve completed a variety of hands-on learning paths through TryHackMe. This project serves as a visual and professional portfolio of the badges I've earned—each one representing a milestone in technical growth, practical application, and persistence.

What's Inside

This repo contains:
- A gallery of all earned TryHackMe badges (with brief descriptions of each room or pathway)
- Insights from key challenges and what they taught me
- Reflections on how these experiences align with my goal of becoming a Cloud Security Engineer
